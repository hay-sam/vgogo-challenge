I think that the biggest reason why this filter isn't helpful is that it doesn't include any way for user's to find the closest event to them. It is simply a list of locations and they have to pick one. There is no way to gauge distance, it's just a city and a country.

A better thing might be for a user to input an address/zipcode and a distance (10mi, 50mi, etc...) that they would be willing to travel and then filter based off that information. But definitely incorporate more geographic data.

Especially because the data doesn't include states/actual addresses for the venue/location. In this data specifically, there's a concert in Portland, but in the USA there are multiple Portlands (Maine and Oregon), now as a user I might have to go and google the venue name to determine what side of the country the venue is on.

By making the proposed changes, it would be less work for the user, and they could have more helpful insights based on the locations of the venues. The user would be able to see all locations they are willing to travel to as a part of one search result (a little example: a lot of big name artists will have multiple concerts in NYC, some in brooklyn, some in manhattan - that would be 2 different locations, but anyone who can make it to one of those locations can most likely make it to the other and they should show up as part of the same search result)
